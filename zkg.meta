description = GE-SRTP is a proprietary protocol used for communication between a GE PLC and a GE HMI.
    The GE-SRTP protocol parser is based off of the research paper that can be accessed at https://digitalcommons.newhaven.edu/electricalcomputerengineering-facpubs/70/
    Like Modbus, the GE-SRTP protocol can read both discrete and analog inputs.
